# ZUNDER

Zunder is a Nuxt UI compatible Library for building AI Apps, powered by Vue & Tailwind CSS

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE**
> 
> Zunder UI is currently in an early stage of development. The API is subject to change, and breaking changes may occur in future releases. While I encourage you to explore and provide feedback, please use caution.

## Why Zunder?

While Nuxt UI provides an excellent foundation for building Vue applications, there's a growing need for components specifically tailored to AI-driven interfaces. Zunder fills this gap by offering:

- AI-specific components for chat interfaces
- Elements designed for text and image generation tasks
- Tools for displaying and interacting with AI model outputs
- Seamless integration with existing Nuxt UI components
- Demos (Chat, Image Analysis, RAG, etc.)

Whether you're building a chatbot, a content generation tool, or a complex AI-powered application, Zunder provides the building blocks you need to create intuitive and powerful user interfaces.

## Features

- Built on top of @nuxt/ui
- Fully customizable components
